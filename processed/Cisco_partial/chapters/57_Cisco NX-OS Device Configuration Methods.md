## Cisco NX-OS Device Configuration Methods

You can use these methods to configure Cisco NX-OS devices:

- • The CLI from a Secure Shell (SSH) session, a Telnet session, or the console port. SSH provides a secure connection to the device. The CLI configuration guides are organized by feature. For more information, see the Cisco NX-OS configuration guides. For more information about SSH and Telnet, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide.

- • The XML management interface, which is a programmatic method based on the NETCONF protocol that complements the CLI. For more information, see the Cisco NX-OS XML Interface User Guide.

- • The Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) client, which runs on your local PC and uses web services on the Cisco NDFC server. The Cisco NDFC server configures the device over the XML management interface. For more information about the Cisco NDFC client, see the Cisco NDFC Fundamentals Guide.
