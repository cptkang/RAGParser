## Bash Shell

The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches support direct Linux shell access. With Linux shell support, you can access the Linux system on the switch in order to use Linux commands and manage the underlying system. For more information about Bash shell support, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide.
