## Tcl

Tool Command Language (Tcl) is a scripting language. With Tcl, you gain more flexibility in your use of the CLI commands on the device. You can use Tcl to extract certain values in the output of a show command, perform switch configurations, run Cisco NX-OS commands in a loop, or define EEM policies in a script.
