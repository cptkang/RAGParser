## Broadcom Shell

The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch front-panel and fabric module line cards contain several Broadcom ASICs. You can use the CLI to access the command-line shell (bcm shell) for these ASICs. The benefit of using this method to access the bcm shell is that you can use Cisco NX-OS command extensions such as pipe include and redirect output to file to manage the output. In addition, the activity is recorded in the system accountinglogforauditpurposes,unlikecommandsentereddirectlyfromthebcmshell,whicharenotrecorded in the accounting log. For more information about Broadcom shell support, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide.
