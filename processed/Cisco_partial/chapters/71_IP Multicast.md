For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide.

The Cisco NX-OS software supports IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) and the following routing protocols:

- • Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol Versions 2 (IPv4) and 3 (IPv6)

- • Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6)

- • Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) (IPv4 and IPv6)

- • Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) (IPv4 only)

- • Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2) (IPv4 only)

The Cisco NX-OS software implementations of these protocols are fully compliant with the latest standards and include 4-byte autonomous system numbers (ASNs) and incremental shortest path first (SPF). All unicast protocols support Non-Stop Forwarding Graceful Restart (NSF-GR). All protocols support all interface types, including Ethernet interfaces, VLAN interfaces, subinterfaces, port channels, and loopback interfaces.

For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide.

The following IP services are available in the Cisco NX-OS software:

- • Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)

- • Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) helper

- • Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)

- • Enhanced object tracking

- • Policy-based routing (PBR)

- • Unicast graceful restart for all protocols in IPv4 unicast graceful restart for OPSFv3 in IPv6

For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide.

The Cisco NX-OS software includes the following multicast protocols and functions:

- • Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Version 2 (PIMv2)

- • PIM sparse mode (Any-Source Multicast [ASM] for IPv4)

- • Anycast rendezvous point (Anycast-RP)

- • Multicast NSF for IPv4

- • RP-Discovery using bootstrap router (BSR) (Auto-RP and static)
