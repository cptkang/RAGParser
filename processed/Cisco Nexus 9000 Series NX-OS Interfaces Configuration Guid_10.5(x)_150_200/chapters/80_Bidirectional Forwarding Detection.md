## Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a protocol designed to quickly identify faults in the forwarding pathbetweentwodevices.BFDsimplifiesnetworkprofilingandplanningbyofferingpredictablereconvergence

time.

BFD detects forwarding path failures across various media types, encapsulations, topologies, and routing protocols. It provides subsecond failure detection between two adjacent devices, distributing some load onto the data plane on supported modules. BFD can be less CPU-intensive than protocol hello messages.
