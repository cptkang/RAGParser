## Note

The default value is infinite (that is no timer is running). The range of BFD Start Timer value for port-channel is from 60 to 3600 seconds. For start timer to work, configure start timer value before completing the port-channel BFD configurations (that is before port-channel bfd track-member-link and port-channel bfd destination are configured for Layer 3 port-channel interface with the active members).
