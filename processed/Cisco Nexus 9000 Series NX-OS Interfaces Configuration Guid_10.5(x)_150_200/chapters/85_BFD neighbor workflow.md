The figure details the BFD neighbor sessions establishment between two routers.

The stages that establish a BFD neighbor session are:

1. The OSPF process discovers a BFD neighbor.

2. The local BFD process gets a request to start a session BFD neighbor session with the OSPF neighbor router.

3. The session is established between the BFD neighbor with the OSPF neighbor router.
