## Before you begin

Log in to a session on the console port.

Ensure that the configuration file that you want to download is in the correct directory on the remote server.

Ensure that the permissions on the file are set correctly. Permissions on the file should be set to world-read.

Ensure that your device has a route to the remote server. Your device and the remote server must be in the same subnetwork if you do not have a router or a default gateway to route traffic between subnets.

Check connectivity to the remote server using the ping or ping6 command.
