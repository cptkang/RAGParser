## Downloading the Startup Configuration From a Remote Server

You can configure your Cisco NX-OS device by using configuration files that you created on another Cisco NX-OS device and uploaded to a remote server. You then download the file from the remote server to your device using TFTP, FTP, Secure Copy (SCP), or Secure Shell FTP (SFTP) to the startup configuration.

This procedure disrupts all traffic on the Cisco NX-OS device.
