## Guidelines and Limitations

NXDC has the following guidelines and limitations:

- • You must configure DNS.

- • You must ensure svc.intersight.com gets resolved and allow outbound initiated HTTPS connections on port 443.

If a proxy is required for an HTTPS connection to svc.intersight.com, the proxy can be configured in the NXDC user interface. For proxy configuration, see Configuring NXDC.
