## About Network Plug and Play

Network Plug and Play (PnP) is a software application that runs on a Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switch (specifically, N9K-C9504, N9K-C9508, and N9K-C9516). The PnP feature provides a simple, secure, unified, and integrated offering to make a new branch or campus rollouts much easier, or for provisioning updates to an existing or a new network. This feature provides a unified approach to provision networks comprising multiple devices with a near-zero-touch deployment experience.

Simplifieddeploymentreducesthecostandcomplexityandincreasesthespeedandsecurityofthedeployments. The PnP feature helps simplify the deployment of any Cisco device by automating the following deployment-related operational tasks:

- • Establishing initial network connectivity for a device.

- • Delivering device configuration to the controller.

- • Delivering software and firmware images to the controller.

- • Provisioning local credentials of a switch.

- • Notifying other management systems about deployment-related events.

The PnP is a client-server based model. The client (agent) runs on a Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switch and the server (controller) runs on the Cisco DNA Controller.

PnP uses a secure connection to communicate between the agent and the controller. This communication is encrypted.

For information on configuring and managing the needed security certificate(s) for PnP functionality, see the Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center Security Best Practices Guide.
