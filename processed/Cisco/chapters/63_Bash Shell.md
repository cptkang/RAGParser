## Bash Shell

You can configure the switch to publish the output of the API calls in either XML or JSON format. For more information about the Cisco NX-API, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide.

- Note NX-API performs authentication through a programmable authentication module (PAM) on the switch. Use cookies to reduce the number of PAM authentications and thus reduce the load on PAM.
