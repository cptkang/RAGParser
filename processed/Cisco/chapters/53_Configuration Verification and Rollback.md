## Configuration Verification and Rollback

The Cisco NX-OS software allows you to verify the consistency of a configuration and the availability of necessary hardware resources prior to committing the configuration. You can preconfigure a device and apply the verified configuration at a later time. Configurations also include checkpoints that allow you to roll back to a known good configuration as needed. For more information about rollbacks, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide.
