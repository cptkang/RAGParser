## Clock Manager

The Cisco NX-OS device might contain clocks of different types that might need to be synchronized. These clocks are a part of various components (such as the supervisor, line card processors, or line cards), and each might be using a different protocol.

The clock manager provides a way to synchronize these different clocks.
