## Guidelines and Limitations for Network Plug and Play

Network Plug and Play (PnP) guidelines and limitations are as follows:

- • Beginning with NX-OS 9.2(3), PnP is supported on the management port of Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches.

- • PnP runs on both the in-band and the management interfaces. In-band is supported only on FX-series line cards (specifically N9K-X9736C-FX for PnP).

- • The PnP deployment method depends on the discovery process that is required for finding the PnP controller or server.

- • The discovery mechanism must be deployed, either as a DHCP server discovery process or a Domain Name Server (DNS) discovery process, before launching PnP.
