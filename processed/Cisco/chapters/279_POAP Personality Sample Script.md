## POAP Personality Sample Script

The following sample POAP script (poap.py) includes the personality feature:

#md5sum="b00a7fffb305d13a1e02cd0d342afca3"

# The above is the (embedded) md5sum of this file taken without this line, # can be # created this way:

- # f=poap.py ; cat $f | sed '/^#md5sum/d' > $f.md5 ; sed -i "s/^#md5sum=.*/#md5sum=$(md5sum $f.md5 | sed 's/ .*//')/" $f # This way this script's integrity can be checked in case you do not trust # tftp's ip checksum. This integrity check is done by /isan/bin/poap.bin). # The integrity of the files downloaded later (images, config) is checked # by downloading
