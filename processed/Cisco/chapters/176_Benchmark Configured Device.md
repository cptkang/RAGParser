## Benchmark Configured Device

The root CA certificate chain file for the Non-SUDI-supported script server must be placed in /bootflash/poap/sudi_fs on the Benchmark Configured Server.

<

- Note To change port on the Benchmark Configured Device, use the file-server <port-number> command. Avoid using standard ports such as port 80 (http) and port 443 (https).

The file-server <port-number> command only serves content over the management interface.
