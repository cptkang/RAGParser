## Procedure

If no configuration file is found, the switch boots in POAP mode and displays a prompt that asks if you want to abort POAP and continue with a normal setup.

No entry is required to continue to boot in POAP mode.

Step 3

(Optional) If you want to exit POAP mode and enter the normal interactive setup script, enter y (yes).

The switch boots, and the POAP process begins.
