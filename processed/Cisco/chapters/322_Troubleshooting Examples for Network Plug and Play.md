## Troubleshooting Examples for Network Plug and Play

- • Configure the DHCP server or the DNS server before deploying PnP.

• The PnP server must communicate with the PnP agent.

- • PnP connect does not require a DHCP or DNS configuration.

- • IPv6 support for PnP is not available for Cisco Nexus 9500 Series devices.
