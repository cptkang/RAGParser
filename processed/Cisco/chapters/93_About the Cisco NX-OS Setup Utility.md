## About the Cisco NX-OS Setup Utility

The Cisco NX-OS setup utility is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) mode that guides you through a basic (also called a startup) configuration of the system. The setup utility allows you to configure only enough connectivity for system management.

The setup utility allows you to build an initial configuration file using the System Configuration Dialog. The setup starts automatically when a device has no configuration file in NVRAM. The dialog guides you through initial configuration. After the file is created, you can use the CLI to perform additional configuration.

You can press Ctrl-C at any prompt to skip the remaining configuration options and proceed with what you have configured up to that point, except for the administrator password. If you want to skip answers to any questions, press Enter. If a default answer is not available (for example, the device hostname), the device uses what was previously configured and skips to the next question.
