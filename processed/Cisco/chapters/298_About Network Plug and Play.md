## About Network Plug and Play

- • PoAP starts first when no start-up configuration is present in the system.

• PnP starts later if PoAP does not get provisioned.

- • PoAP and PnP discover the controller alternatively.

- • The controller discovery process continues until a controller or until the admin aborts auto provision.

- • The process (POAP or PnP) that finds the controller continues provisioning and the other process that does not find the controller is notified and eventually terminated.
