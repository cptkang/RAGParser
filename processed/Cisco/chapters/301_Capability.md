## Capability

Capability service request is sent by the PnP server to the PnP agent on a device to query the supported services by the agent. The server then sends an inventory service request to query the device's inventory information; and then sends an image installation request to download an image and install it. After getting the response from the agent, the list of supported PnP services and features are enlisted and returned back to the Server.
