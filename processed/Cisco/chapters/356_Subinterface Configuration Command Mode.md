## Subinterface Configuration Command Mode

From global configuration mode, you can access a configuration submode for configuring VLAN interfaces called subinterfaces. In subinterface configuration mode, you can configure multiple virtual interfaces on a single physical interface. Subinterfaces appear to a protocol as distinct physical interfaces.

Subinterfaces also allow multiple encapsulations for a protocol on a single interface. For example, you can configure IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation to associate a subinterface with a VLAN.

For more information about configuring subinterfaces, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide.
