## Python API

Python is an easy-to-learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python website: http://www.python.org/. The Python scripting capability gives programmatic access to the CLI to perform various tasks and Power-On Auto Provisioning (POAP) or Embedded Event Manager (EEM) actions. For more information about the Python API and Python scripting, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide.
