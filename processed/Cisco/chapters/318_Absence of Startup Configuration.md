## Absence of Startup Configuration

New Cisco devices are shipped to customers with no startup configuration file in the NVRAM of the devices. When a new device is connected to a network and powered on, the absence of a startup configuration file on the device automatically triggers the PnP agent to discover the PnP server IP address.
