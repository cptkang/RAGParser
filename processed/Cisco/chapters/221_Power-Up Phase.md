## Power-Up Phase

When you powerup the device for the first time, it loads the software image that is installed at manufacturing and tries to find a configuration file from which to boot. When a configuration file is not found, POAP mode

starts.

During startup, a prompt appears asking if you want to abort POAP and continue with a normal setup. You can choose to exit or continue with POAP.

<

- Note No user intervention is required for POAP to continue. The prompt that asks if you want to abort POAP remains available until the POAP process is complete.

If you exit POAP mode, you enter the normal interactive setup script. If you continue in POAP mode, all the front-panel interfaces are set up in the default configuration.
