## Abbreviating Commands

You can abbreviate commands and keywords by entering the first few characters of a command. The abbreviation must include sufficient characters to make it unique from other commands or keywords. If you are having trouble entering a command, check the system prompt and enter the question mark (?) for a list of available commands. You might be in the wrong command mode or using incorrect syntax.

This table lists examples of command abbreviations.
